# DatLatGE
A small demonstration of a 2d game engine where a character can move around a grid. It's not much, just something I wanted to try and use my DatLat for (data lattice, see repo of the same name).

Written in raw HTML, CSS and JS. Run `index.html` to have a look.

In retrospect a few years later, I would really revamp this if I had the time. It's quite bad for being a game engine per se, even though it functions, since many things that should be associated with each other, such as collision versus position, are handled far apart from each other.
